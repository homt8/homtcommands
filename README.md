Jail you have reason to send to the command /jail and back spawn /release you can now do within 1 minute to put jail point.

#Guest

There is a setting to decide if you want to allow names with guest in them.
This is settable in settings.txt.


#Password

A setting in the settingstxt to allow you to set whether or not you allow empty passwords.
This can be set in minetest.conf file as well.


#Underworld

This might not fit in this mod but I added it here anyway.

This is a teleporter that when set also places a teleporter below at what ever height you set it at.
Place a teleporter and a form opens. Name the teleporter and set the depth of the other. Click set.
When you step into the teleporter you will teleport down. After 10 seconds you can use the teleporter again.

You need the addprivs_admin priv to place and destroy the teleporters.
